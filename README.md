# TOC Practical List
1. Design a Finite Automata (FA) that accepts all strings over S={0, 1} having three consecutive 1's as 
a substring. Write a program to simulate this FA.

2. Design a Finite Automata (FA) that accepts all strings over S={0, 1} having either exactly two 1's or 
exactly three 1's, not more nor less. Write a program to simulate this FA.

3. Design a Finite Automata (FA) that accepts language L1, over S={a, b}, comprising of all strings (of 
length 4 or more) having first two characters same as the last two. Write a program to simulate this FA.

5. Design a Finite Automata (FA) that accepts language L2, over S= {a, b} where L2= a(a+b)*b. Write 
a program to simulate this FA.

6. Design a Finite Automata (FA) that accepts language EVEN-EVEN over S={a, b}. Write a program 
to simulate this FA
 
7. Write a program to simulate an FA that accepts  
a. Union of the languages L1 and L2 
b. Intersection of the languages L1 and L2 
c. Language L1 L2 (concatenation) 

8. Design a PDA and write a program for simulating the machine which accepts the language 
{anbn  where n>0, S= {a, b}}.

9. Design a PDA and write a program for simulating the machine which accepts the language {wXwr| w 
is any string over S={a, b} and wr is reverse of that string and X is a special symbol }. 
  

10. Design and simulate a Turing Machine that accepts the language anbncn where n >0. 
11. Design and simulate a Turing Machine which will increment the given binary number by 1.
